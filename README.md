# Big Number Arithmetic (and possibly algorithms) in C

This project is an implementation of big number arithmetic. Please note that
this implementation is only an exploration of big number arithmetic. There are
most likely more mature options for production use.

Big Numbers should support the following operations:

- [x] Add
- [x] Subtract (assuming positive result)
- [x] Multiply
- [x] Divide
- [x] Modulo
- [x] Power with Modulo (a^b mod c)
- [x] Comparison (greater than, less than, equal to)
- [x] Print as hex
- [x] Creation from uint32_t
- [x] Creation from hex string
